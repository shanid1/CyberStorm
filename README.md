Create your own room or join existing ones with ease. Battle with — or against — other players in massive free-for-alls or team-based shootouts. There’s no limit to the chaos you can unleash!

🤖 Beware the Bots
In every match, you’re not just fighting players — deadly AI robo-bots roam the map, gunning down anyone in their path. Adapt fast or get outgunned by machine precision!

🔫 Tactical Gunplay
Switch weapons on the fly using your mouse scroll and find the perfect loadout for every situation. From close-range chaos to long-range domination, every encounter is a chance to prove your skill.
